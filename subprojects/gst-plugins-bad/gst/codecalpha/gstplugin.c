/**
 * SECTION:plugin-codecalpha
 *
 * This plugin contains a set of utilities that helps handling alpha encoded
 * streams as produced by some WebM streams using VP8/VP9. The elements are
 * meant to be used in decoder wrappers which allows playbin to automatically
 * handle these streams.
 *
 * `codecalphademux` will produce two streams out of a stream of buffers holding
 * the #GstVideoCodecAlphaMeta. The presence of the meta is indicated by the
 * usage of the field `codec-alpha=(boolean)true` in the caps. This is only
 * applicable to VP8 and VP9 for now.
 *
 * Since: 1.20
